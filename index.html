          <h3>What is Python?</h3>
          <p>
            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido
            van Rossum, and released in 1991.
          </p>
          <p>It is used for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side)</li>
            <li>software development</li>
            <li>mathematics</li>
            <li>system scripting</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>
              Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and
              modify files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex
              mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready
              software development.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Why Python?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux,
              Raspberry Pi, etc).
            </li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>
              Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with
              fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
              executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can
              be very quick.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated
              way or a functional way.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Good to know</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we
              shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not
              being updated with anything other than security updates, is still
              quite popular.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is
              possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment,
              such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are
              particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python
              files.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to
              the English language with influence from mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other
              programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
              such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other
              programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Python Install</h3>
          <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
          <p>
            To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the
            start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line
            (cmd.exe):
          </p>
          <p>
            <code class="code-cmd">C:\Users\Your Name>python --version </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on
            linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
          </p>
          <p><code class="code-cmd">python --version </code></p>
          <p>
            If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer,
            then you can download it for free from the following website:
            https://www.python.org/
          </p>
          <h3>Python Quickstart</h3>
          <p>
            Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a
            developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put
            those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
          </p>
          <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
          <p>
            <code class="code-cmd"
              >C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>
          <p>
            Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can
            be done in any text editor.
          </p>

          <p><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></p>

          <p>
            Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to
            the directory where you saved your file, and run:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code class="code-cmd"
              >C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>The output should read:</p>
          <p><code class="code-cmd">Hello, World!</code></p>
          <p>
            Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python
            program.
          </p>
          <h3>The Python Command Line</h3>
          <p>
            To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest
            and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible
            because Python can be run as a command line itself.
          </p>
          <p>Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:</p>
          <p><code class="code-cmd">C:\Users\Your Name>python </code></p>
          <p>Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":</p>
          <p><code class="code-cmd">C:\Users\Your Name>py </code></p>
          <p>
            From there you can write any python, including our hello world
            example from earlier in the tutorial:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code class="code-cmd"
              >C:\Users\Your Name>python<br />
              Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900
              32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br />
              Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
              information.<br />
              >>> print("Hello, World!")
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:</p>
          <p>
            <code class="code-cmd"
              >C:\Users\Your Name>python<br />
              Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900
              32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br />
              Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
              information.<br />
              >>> print("Hello, World!")<br />
              Hello, World!
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply
            type the following to quit the python command line interface:
          </p>
          <p><code class="code-cmd">exit()</code></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Indentation">
          <header><h2>Python Indentation</h2></header>
          <p>
            Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for
            readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
          </p>
          <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >if 5 > 2:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:</p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>Syntax Error:</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >if 5 > 2:<br />
              print("Five is greater than two!")</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be
            at least one.
          </p>

          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >if 5 > 2:<br />
              &nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")<br />
              if 5 > 2:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code,
            otherwise Python will give you an error:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>Syntax Error:</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >if 5 > 2:<br />
              &nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Five is greater than two!")
            </code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Comments">
          <header><h2>Python Comments</h2></header>
          <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.</p>
          <p>Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
          <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
          <h3>Creating a Comment</h3>
          <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >#This is a comment<br />
              print("Hello, World!")</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore
            the rest of the line:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p><code> print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment </code></p>
          <p>
            Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also
            be used to prevent Python from executing code:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >#print("Hello, World!")<br />
              print("Cheers, Mate!")
            </code>
          </p>
          <h3>Multi Line Comments</h3>
          <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.</p>
          <p>To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:</p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >#This is a comment<br />
              #written in<br />
              #more than just one line<br />
              print("Hello, World!")</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.</p>
          <p>
            Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a
            variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your
            code, and place your comment inside it:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >"""<br />
              This is a comment<br />
              written in<br />
              more than just one line<br />
              """<br />
              print("Hello, World!")</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will
            read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline
            comment.
          </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Python Variables Section -->
        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
          <header><h2>Python Variables</h2></header>
          <h3>Creating Variables</h3>
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
          <p>
            Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for
            declaring a variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = 5<br />
              y = "John"<br />
              print(x)<br />
              print(y)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and
            can even change type after they have been set.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = 4 # x is of type int<br />
              x = "Sally" # x is now of type str<br />
              print(x)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            String variables can be declared either by using single or double
            quotes:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "John"<br />
              # is the same as<br />
              x = 'John'</code
            >
          </p>
          <h3>Variable Names</h3>
          <p>
            A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more
            descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python
            variables:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
              character
            </li>
            <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
            <li>
              A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
              underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
            </li>
            <li>
              Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
              different variables)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example</p>

          <h3>Assign Value to Multiple Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one
            line:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"<br />
              print(x)<br />
              print(y)<br />
              print(z)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = y = z = "Orange"<br />
              print(x)<br />
              print(y)<br />
              print(z)</code
            >
          </p>
          <h3>Output Variables</h3>
          <p>The Python print statement is often used to output variables.</p>
          <p>
            To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "awesome"<br />
              print("Python is " + x)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use the + character to add a variable to another
            variable:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "Python is "<br />
              y = "awesome"<br />
              z = x + y<br />
              print(z)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:</p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = 5<br />
              y = 10<br />
              print(x + y)</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an
            error:
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>Syntax Error</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = 5<br />
              y = "John"<br />
              print(x + y)</code
            >
          </p>
          <h3>Global Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the
            examples above) are known as global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions
            and outside.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the
            function
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "awesome"<br />
              <br />
              def myfunc():<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Python is " + x)<br />
              <br />
              myfunc()
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this
            variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function.
            The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global
            and with the original value.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the
            global variable
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "awesome"<br />
              <br />
              def myfunc():<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;x = "fantastic"<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Python is " + x)<br />
              <br />
              myfunc()<br />
              <br />
              print("Python is " + x)
            </code>
          </p>
          <h3>The global Keyword</h3>
          <p>
            Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that
            variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the
            global keyword.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global
            scope:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >def myfunc():<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;global x<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;x = "fantastic"<br />
              <br />
              myfunc()<br />
              <br />
              print("Python is " + x)
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable
            inside a function.
          </p>
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>
            To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to
            the variable by using the global keyword:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code
              >x = "awesome"<br />
              <br />
              def myfunc():<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;global x<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;x = "fantastic"<br />
              <br />
              myfunc()<br />
              <br />
              print("Python is " + x)</code
            >
          </p>
